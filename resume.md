### Summary

I'm a sofware builder with a generalist background, forged as a professional during an almost constant economic crisis.

I adapt fast to new contexts. I can shape and deliver projects with specific budgets and deadlines, working alonside domain experts to understand tradeoffs. I find joy in writing simple code, mentoring and, more recently, in playing the piano :musical_keyboard:.

### Some things I've done

- Designed and implemented a subscription billing system that could be tweaked to our needs, using only Ruby on Rails, featuring payment gateway integrations, internal accounting, in-app notifications and debtor management
- Refactored one of the oldest models of our e-learning platform, safely removing code that was preventing us to build over it
- Developed several modules to increase developer productivity, allowing our team to easily add notifications, events and support tickets to application models
- Lead the launch and production of five 3D printer models in less than 5 years, period in which the yearly inflation rate was about 30% and the argentinean peso was one of the weakest currencies in the world 
- Built teams of designers and engineers, from headcount planning and interviewing to onboarding and mentoring

### Stack

Ruby (with Rspec) - Ruby On Rails (with Hotwire) - Vanilla JS - Postgresql - Linux (Arch mainly, also Ubuntu)

### Professional Experience

**Jun 2020- Dec 2022. Nulinga (~ 2.5 years)**

Nulinga is an e-learning platform that offers language learning solutions to corporate clients.

Spent my first year as a full stack developer, then took some projects as a tech lead. I could also spend part of my time helping scale the team without having to resign the joy of coding. That was, thinking and reading basically, but also using what we learned to interview, select, help onboard and mentor other team members. Heavily influenced by 37signals and the Shape Up approach to product development.

**May 2013- Dec 2017. Trimaker (~ 5 years)**

Leading 3D printing company that develops & designs technology in Buenos Aires, manufactures in China and distributes around the world.

Started as responsible for the production and delivery of the first batch of 3D printers and ended up managing the whole operation, from logistics to customer service, designing all the required processes. Helped raise funding and launch 5 printer models in a very short period with an almost continuous economic crisis. We also launched a customer focused digital manufacturing business unit.

### Other skills

- I've mentored projects for about 7 years at a free entrepreneurship course at Buenos Aires University, trying to help entrepreneurs understand their business and survive.
- I speak english :gb:, spanish :es: and a bit of italian (learning) :it:.
- I'm teaching myself some system design with C. I've played with Python.

### Formal education

**Mar 2007- Nov 2013** - Industrial Engineering. *Universidad de Buenos Aires*.
