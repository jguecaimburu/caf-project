            <p>I'm a sofware builder with a generalist background,
            forged as a professional during an almost constant
            economic crisis.</p>
            <p>I adapt fast to new contexts. I can shape and deliver
            projects with specific budgets and deadlines, working
            alonside domain experts to understand tradeoffs. I find
            joy in writing simple code, mentoring and, more recently, in playing
            the piano <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias=

            <ul>
                <li>Designed and implemented a subscription billing
                system that could be tweaked to our needs, using only
                Ruby on Rails, featuring payment gateway
                integrations, internal accounting, in-app
                notifications and debtor management</li>
                <li>Refactored one of the oldest models of our
                e-learning platform, safely removing code that was
                preventing us to build over it</li>
                <li>Developed several modules to increase developer
                productivity, allowing our team to easily add
                notifications, events and support tickets to
                application models</li>
                <li>Lead the launch and production of five 3D printer
                models in less than 5 years, period in which the
                yearly inflation rate was about 30% and the
                argentinean peso was one of the weakest currencies in
                the world</li>
                <li>Built teams of designers and engineers, from
                headcount planning and interviewing to onboarding and
                mentoring</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Ruby (with Rspec) - Ruby On Rails (with Hotwire) -
            Vanilla JS - Postgresql - Linux (Arch mainly, also
            Ubuntu)</p>

            <p><strong>Jun 2020- Dec 2022. Nulinga (~ 2.5
            years)</strong></p>
            <p>Nulinga is an e-learning platform that offers language
            learning solutions to corporate clients.</p>
            <p>Spent my first year as a full stack developer, then
            took some projects as a tech lead. I could also spend
            part of my time helping scale the team without having to
            resign the joy of coding. That was, thinking and reading
            basically, but also using what we learned to interview,
            select, help onboard and mentor other team members.
            Heavily influenced by 37signals and the Shape Up approach
            to product development.</p>
            <p><strong>May 2013- Dec 2017. Trimaker (~ 5
            years)</strong></p>
            <p>Leading 3D printing company that develops & designs
            technology in Buenos Aires, manufactures in China and
            distributes around the world.</p>
            <p>Started as responsible for the production and delivery
            of the first batch of 3D printers and ended up managing
            the whole operation, from logistics to customer service,
            designing all the required processes. Helped raise
            funding and launch 5 printer models in a very short
            period with an almost continuous economic crisis. We also
            launched a customer focused digital manufacturing
            business unit.</p>
