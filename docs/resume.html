            <p>I'm a highly independent sofware builder with a
            generalist background, forged as a professional during an
            almost constant economic crisis.</p>
            <p>I read and understand complex code fast. I can easily
            adapt to new contexts, domains, tools and codebases. I
            can shape and deliver projects with specific budgets and
            deadlines, working alonside domain experts to understand
            tradeoffs. I can design and adapt processes and rituals
            for teams looking to build great products fast.</p>
            <p>I find joy in writing simple code, mentoring and, more
            recently, in playing the piano ðŸŽ¹.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Designed and implemented a subscription billing
                system that could be tweaked to our needs, using
                vanilla Ruby on Rails, featuring payment gateway
                integrations, internal accounting, in-app
                notifications and debtor management</li>
                <li>Rearchitectured flows handling +10M daily
                background jobs to increase system observability and
                allow easy recovery after outages</li>
                <li>Refactored core models of different platforms,
                safely removing code that was preventing us from
                building faster</li>
                <li>Shaped dozens of projects with different budgets,
                restrictions, in very different domains</li>
                <li>Lead the launch and production of five 3D printer
                models in less than 5 years, period in which the
                yearly inflation rate was about 30% and the
                argentinean peso was one of the weakest currencies in
                the world</li>
                <li>Built teams of designers and engineers, from
                headcount planning and interviewing to onboarding and
                mentoring</li>

            <p><strong>Apr 2023 - Current. SparkLoop</strong></p>
            <p>SparkLoop makes the leading newsletter referral tools
            for creators and media companies looking to grow their
            email-lists faster and more affordably.</p>
            <p>I'm leading a team of amazing devs deliver projects
            faster and better, shaping projects but also reviewing
            code and mentoring, heavily influenced by Shape-Up. In
            this hybrid position, I also focus on identifying
            bottlenecks and removing them, either by implementing new
            rituals or by refactoring code to keep the codebase in
            good shape.</p>
            <p><strong>Jun 2020 - Dec 2022. Nulinga (~ 2.5
            years)</strong></p>
            <p>Nulinga is an e-learning platform that offers language
            learning solutions to corporate clients.</p>
            <p>Spent my first year as a full stack developer, then
            took some projects as a tech lead. I could also spend
            part of my time helping scale the team without having to
            resign the joy of coding. That was, thinking and reading
            basically, but also using what we learned to interview,
            select, help onboard and mentor other team members.
            Heavily influenced by 37signals and the Shape Up approach
            to product development.</p>
            <p><strong>May 2013 - Dec 2017. Trimaker (~ 5
            years)</strong></p>
            <p>Leading 3D printing company that develops & designs
            technology in Buenos Aires, manufactures in China and
            distributes around the world.</p>
            <p>Started as responsible for the production and delivery
            of the first batch of 3D printers and ended up managing
            the whole operation, from logistics to customer service,
            designing all the required processes. Helped raise
            funding and launch 5 printer models in a very short
            period with an almost continuous economic crisis. We also
            launched a customer focused digital manufacturing
            business unit.</p>
